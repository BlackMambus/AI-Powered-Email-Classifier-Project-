# AI-Powered-Email-Classifier-Project-

An AI-powered email classifier is a smart tool designed to automatically organize, sort, and label incoming emails using machine learning algorithms. It mimics the way humans interpret messages‚Äîbut with much more speed and scale.

üîç Core Features
Content-Based Classification: It analyzes the subject line, body text, sender metadata, and even attachments to determine the nature of the email.

Categorization: Emails are sorted into predefined categories like Promotions, Personal, Work, Spam, Newsletters, Social, and more.

Priority Scoring: High-priority or time-sensitive emails are flagged based on urgency cues, keywords, and sender importance.

Custom Rules and Learning: The classifier can learn user behavior‚Äîso if you tend to reply quickly to finance-related emails, it‚Äôll adapt and surface them more prominently.

Spam and Phishing Detection: It uses anomaly detection and natural language processing to identify harmful or unwanted messages.
